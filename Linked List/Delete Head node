def deleteHead(head):
    # Case 1: empty list
    if head is None:
        return None

    # Case 2: only one node
    if head.next is None:
        return None

    # Case 3: more than one node
    new_head = head.next
    new_head.prev = None
    return new_head

#TC:O(1)
#SC:O(1)

Because head is just a local variable inside the function.

Your code:
new_head = head.next
new_head.prev = None
return new_head


When you do:

head = deleteHead(head)


👉 The returned new_head becomes the new head outside the function.
