#TC:O(n^2) this is optimal for this problem
#SC:O(1) cause dictionary can hold upto 26 alphabets 
#“Although we use a frequency array/dictionary, it stores counts for a fixed character set (26 lowercase letters). 
#Since the size of the data structure does not grow with input size, the space complexity is O(1).”
